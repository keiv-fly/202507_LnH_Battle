# Main Design Principles

This project is a turn-based battle arena game built with Phaser 3 and Vite. The following principles guide development:

- **Modularity**: Keep game logic in independent modules to simplify testing and future expansion.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Core systems should be isolated from rendering and UI layers.
- **Extensibility**: Use a plugin-friendly architecture so new features can be added without disrupting existing code.
- **Maintainability**: Prioritize clear organization and readability across all source files.
- **Testing**: Ensure that each component can be tested in isolation using Jest and Playwright.
